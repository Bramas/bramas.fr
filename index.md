About
=====

I am a PhD student at the LIP6 laboratory of the University of Paris 6, with Professor Sébastien Tixeuil.  My work is supported by the SMART Labex under the SMART-BAN Project (Self Organizing, Mobility Aware, Reliable and Timely Body Area Networks)

I am working on:

 - Body Area Networks
 - Time varying graphs
 - Autonomous mobile robots

I studied mathematics at the University of Clermont-Ferrand and computer science at the University of Paris 5.
